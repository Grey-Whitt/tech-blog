## Description
This is a fully functioning forum/blog style website which uses the full stack. Users can sign up, log in, post, comment, like, and registered users have limited access to features like posting, upvoting, and commenting, as well as the user dashboard. No starter code was provided and it took about 3 days to make. Day 1 was used to set up the data base and routes, day 2 was used to set up the front end, and day 3 was used to get the front and back end to communicate with each other.You can view the website and make an account here -
